 <h2><span style="color:red">Reason NOT to get a Windows PC</span></h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Malware!: The biggest disadvantage of choosing a Windows over a Mac is that Windows is the most targeted operating system by malware because it is so widely used</li>
   <li>Lower cost = poor quality: Lower Costs laptops are often built with cheaper and often less reliable components, so this can impact the reliabiltiy and long-term performance</li>
   <li>Manufacturers: None of the hardware manufacturers have anything to do with the operating system, so each one must create specific drivers and figure out compatibility issues with the components that they use in each group</li>
  </ol>
